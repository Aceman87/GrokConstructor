================

Grok is a collection of named regular expressions that can be used - for instance with logstash http://logstash.net/ -
to parse logfiles. GrokDiscovery http://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/ can somewhat help you by suggesting regular 
expressions. GrokDiscoveryToo will go beyond that by finding many possible regular expressions 
that match a whole set of logfile lines by using groks patterns and fixed strings.

Status: just starting.
