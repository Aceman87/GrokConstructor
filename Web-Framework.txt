Since IntelliJ Community Edition does not have a web framework plugin for scala at the moments and
I don't currently know either Play nor Lift and both seem to be annoying without a plugin, I decide
to roll my own mini-framework for now.

Basic idea: The interesting parts of the page are done in Scala classes with its XML mode,
since then I have code completion for that. (OTOH, if you don't know HTML by heart, a HTML completion is
very valuable as well. But I can't have both right now.) There is a JSP for the frame of the page. It
takes various parts from to-Stringable request attributes.
