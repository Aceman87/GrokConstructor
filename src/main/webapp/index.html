<p>If you like it please tell <a href="http://www.stoerr.net/">me</a>, as this mightily encourages further improvements
    to this service.
    If you want to make me really happy please include suggestions, bugs, regular expressions you found useful, real
    life examples where
    the service gives particularily good or bad results, or some CSS that would make these pages look halfway decent.
