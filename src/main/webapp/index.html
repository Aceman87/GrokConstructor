            right now you can just use the main menu to go to the applications. There is
            a short explanation at the top, and you can call up a random example to try things out.

        <h4>What is this about?</h4>

        <p><a href="http://logstash.net/">Logstash</a> is a tool to collect log files from various sources, parse them
            into a JSON
            format
            and put them into one or more databases, index engines and so forth. In the simplest case you can
            slurp log files from the filesystem, parse them using grok - a collection of named regular expressions - and
            put them into the integrated elastic search engine with a simple web frontend to search them.
            In my experience the hardest part is to get the regular expressions for parsing the log files right.
            The <a href="http://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/">Grok debugger</a> can help you test your regular expressions
            and provides
            Grok Discovery that sometimes can suggest regular expressions. This site, GrokDiscovery<sup>2</sup> (read:
            Grok Discovery Too) goes beyond that by providing an incremental construction process that helps you to
            construct a regular expression
            that matches all of a set of given log lines, and provides you a matcher where you can simultaneously try
            out your regular expression on several log lines.
        </p>

        <h4>Incremental Construction</h4>

        <p>As input you provide a number of log lines and select the libraries of grok patterns you want to choose from.
            It is possible to give additional grok patterns as well. Starting from <code>\A</code> we step by step
            construct a regular expression that matches all log lines simultaneously.
            In each step you are prompted to select either a common prefix of the yet unmatched rests of the log lines,
            or select one of the patterns from the grok library that matches a start segment of all rests of the log
            lines, or input a pattern that matches the next segment. In each case the next segment is usually the next
            logigal entity to be parsed in the lines.</p>

        <h4>Matcher</h4>

        <p>The matcher allows you to check whether a regular expression matches all of a given set of log lines,
            and </p>

        <h4>Automatic Construction</h4>

        <p>This was my first attempt at this; it is included more for fun than for usefulness. The idea is to find all 
        </p>

        <h4>Common features</h4>

        <p>All services are session-less. Thus, you can open arbitrarily many windows simultaneously without conflicts.
            Applying a <a href="http://logstash.net/docs/1.1.10/filters/multiline">multline filter</a> to collect
            several lines that compose one log message (e.g. the message and a stacktrace) is also supported.</p>

            improvements
            to this service.
            If you want to make me really happy please include suggestions, bugs, regular expressions you found useful,
            real
            life examples where
            the service gives particularily good or bad results, or some CSS that would make these pages look halfway
            decent.
